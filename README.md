A Decentralized Autonomous Organization Proof of Concept

- [Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_Autonomous_Organization)

DAO is a decentralized network of narrow-AI autonomous agents which perform an output-maximizing production function and which divides its labor into computationally intractable tasks (which it incentivizes humans to do) and tasks which it performs itself.

## Core Idea

Based on Idea of Decentralized Autonomous Organization. [1]

## Principles

- They are corporations – they are free and independent persons (but don’t have legal personality).
- They are autonomous – once up to speed, they no longer need (or heed) their creators.
- They are distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.
- They are transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all.
- They are confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.
- They are trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.
- They are fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders’ interests.
- They are self-regulating – they robotically obey their own rules.
- They are incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.
- They are sovereign – over their digital resources (but don't have legal capacity).[5]

## Technologies 

- [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) - anonymous communication
- [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)) - distributed data store that holds a public ledger of transactions  

## Consensus

- [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) - Family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors. Consensus is the process of agreeing on one result among a group of participants.
- [Raft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science)) - Raft is a consensus algorithm designed as an alternative to Paxos.

## Processes

*A business process or business method is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product (serve a particular goal) for a particular customer or customers.* [4]

### Voting

*Voting is a method for a group such as a meeting or an electorate to make a decision or express an opinion—often following discussions, debates, or election campaigns. Democracies elect holders of high office by voting.*
