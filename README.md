- [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_Autonomous_Organization)

## Core Idea

Based on Idea of Decentralized Autonomous Organization. [1]


## Principles

- They are corporations – they are free and independent persons (but don’t have legal personality).
- They are autonomous – once up to speed, they no longer need (or heed) their creators.
- They are distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.
- They are transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all.
- They are confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.
- They are trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.
- They are fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders’ interests.
- They are self-regulating – they robotically obey their own rules.
- They are incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.
- They are sovereign – over their digital resources (but don't have legal capacity).[5]
